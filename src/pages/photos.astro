    <Paragraph>
        My passion for photography began in 8th grade with my trusty Huawei P30 Pro and its LEICA lens.
        Since then, I’ve loved capturing the unique scenes I encounter day to day.
        This gallery is a curated collection of my favorite shots (most are fairly recent).

        Photos marked with the redirect icon  (<ExternalIcon classlist="w-4 inline"/>) will open the original post on my Instagram.

    <PhotoGallery allImages={complete_images} client:load />
