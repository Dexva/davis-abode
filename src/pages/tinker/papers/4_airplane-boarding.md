**🏅 Rank 9 Award at the _[International Mathematical Modeling Challenge (IMMC) 2022](https://www.immchallenge.org/)_**. In this paper, we developed a two-part model to analyze and optimize airplane passenger flow. For boarding, we created a computational Monte Carlo simulation to estimate times for various methods, accounting for randomized passenger parameters. For disembarking, we derived a closed-form formula to calculate the optimal deplaning time for any given aircraft configuration.
