🏆 **Winner of the Distinction and Novelty Award at _[SIMC 2.0 2024](https://simc2024.net/)_**. This paper presents our solution to a challenge problem in single-particle imaging. We developed deterministic and heuristic techniques to cluster image orientations in both noiseless and noisy 2D datasets. Our key methods included perceptual image hashing for the noiseless data and a modified K-means algorithm for the noisy data.
