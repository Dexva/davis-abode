🏆 **High Distinction (Top 3, Junior Track) at _SIMC 2.0 2022_**. This paper models the spread of a hypothetical "duovid" virus across a community represented as a network, employing a multi-level approach based on network complexity. We began by deducing infection properties analytically for simple, lattice-like networks. As complexity increased, we utilized graph traversal algorithms to simulate the spread, culminating in the use of regression models with graph feature engineering to generate results for the most complex community structures.
