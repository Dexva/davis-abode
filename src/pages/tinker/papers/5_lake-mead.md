**🏅 Finalist Award at the [High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling (HiMCM) 2021]((https://www.contest.comap.com/highschool/contests/himcm/instructions.html))**. This paper presents our comprehensive, three-part analysis of the Lake Mead water crisis. We first applied statistical methods to identify trends in the lake's declining water levels, then developed a calculus-based model to estimate the remaining water volume. These findings culminated in a detailed proposal for a new wastewater recycling plant to address the issue.
