# S.E.A.

This was perhaps my biggest, long-term project so far. Our group (Team S.E.A.) received a research grant, under DOST-PCIEERD's Young Innovators Program, to pursue a developmental project with the title shown.

Primarily based on research from the Bazant Group (MIT), our team worked on applying shock electrodialysis (SED), an emerging electrokinetic/electrochemical desalination technology, to a prototype suited for Philippine coastal communities.

We interviewed people from Calatagan, Batangas, iteratively designed and tested varying SED cells, and fabricated a to-scale SEA prototype using the equipment in our school's fabrication laboratory.

Since we were really young when we started (not even Grade 9 then), this was an amazing learning and growth experience for the team.
