# Space Jam

_My first-ever coding project: a classic asteroid shooter built in Scratch._

Developed during the summer of 8th grade, Space Jam was the project that kicked off my coding journey. It’s a simple asteroid shooter, inspired by a typing game I used to play, and was built entirely using [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/), MIT's block-based programming tool.

While the game was simple, it was a significant milestone. I created it while taking Harvard's CS50 course through edX and proudly submitted it as my final assignment, marking the official start of my passion for building things with code.
