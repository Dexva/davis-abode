# FlexiClaw
_A scalable, single-piece compliant mechanism to replace multi-part rigid claws._

FlexiClaw was our team's submission to the ACAM 2021 Winnovator Techfest, a project for which I was the principal designer.

## The Challenge
Traditional rigid claw mechanisms rely on multiple parts, making them prone to wear and tear and difficult to fabricate at micro-scales.

## Design Concept
Inspired by research from the [BYU Compliant Mechanisms Research Group](https://www.compliantmechanisms.byu.edu/), FlexiClaw is a monolithic (single-piece) bi-claw mechanism. This structure minimizes failure points and allows for easy fabrication—we even 3D-printed a working prototype with a standard Ender 3 printer.

## Key Outcome
In 2024, the design was successfully registered as an industrial design intellectual property in the Philippines.
