# S.E.A. (Shock Electrodialysis Apparatus)

_A grant-funded research project to develop a community-focused desalination prototype._

## The Mission

Backed by a research grant from the [DOST-PCIEERD](https://www.facebook.com/pcieerd/) Young Innovators Program, our team's mission was to develop a practical water desalination solution for Philippine coastal communities.

## Our Technical Approach
Our work focused on adapting shock electrodialysis (SED)—an emerging technology pioneered by the Bazant Group at MIT—for real-world application. We aimed to create a prototype that was both effective and appropriate for the local context.

## Project Lifecycle
Our process was comprehensive, covering the full development cycle:
- **Community Research**: We conducted interviews with residents in Calatagan, Batangas, to understand their firsthand needs.
- **Iterative R&D**: We designed, tested, and refined multiple Shock Electrodialysis (SED) cell configurations.
- **Prototyping**: Using our school’s fabrication lab, we built a to-scale working prototype of the S.E.A. system.

## Key Takeaways
As a long-term project undertaken in high school, S.E.A. was a formative experience in applying advanced research to solve tangible problems. It was instrumental in developing my skills in user research, iterative design, and hands-on fabrication.
