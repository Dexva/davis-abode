# Operation: Haunted

... or _OpHaunt_ for short. This was my first real game development project!
I consider it "real" because I was finally coding on an IDE for this project.

OpHaunt is a metroidvania game where you play as a robot whose objective is to hunt down all the ghosts that haunt the hotel. But, be careful! Some ghosts chase you down, while others shoot back at you. 

OpHaunt was developed from scratch because it was for a Java course back in 10th Grade. My team also made the _wonderful_ decision of developing with Java Swing. Since we couldn't use any physics libraries either, the development process became very instructive as it thought us how to address seemingly-simple aspects of games, like camera movement, map generation, character kinematics, and graphics. We even wrote up some remarks on this experience.


Our one user-tester (a.k.a. my 7-year-old nephew) gave the following review:

> 9/10

I'd call that a success!
