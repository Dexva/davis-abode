# Operation: Haunted

My first (actual) game development project! The catch: we had to make it from scratch... without a game engine to help (how tedious fun).

This was our Computer Science 4 capstone project and it was made using Java Swing. In this metroidvania game, you play as a robot whose objective is to hunt down all the ghosts on the map. Some ghosts chase you, while some shoot back at you.

Since the game was made with java (and no game engine or library imported), the performance might be a bit unoptimized. Still, my 7-year-old nephew says it's a 9/10 game, so trust the gamer expert's opinion, I guess?
