# Space Jam

This is the first game I coded. Space Jam is a simple asteroid shooter game inspired by a type-racing game I used to play. I also applied 

I created this back in late 2020, during the summer of my 8th Grade (i.e., around the start of the pandemic). This was built using [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/), an online drag-and-drop block programming tool originating from MIT.

This also became my assignment submission for EdX Harvard CS50, an online course I was doing at the time.
