Distinction and Novelty Award paper from [SIMC 2.0 2024](https://simc2024.net/). This paper presents our challenge solution to a lower-dimensional (2D) toy problem of single particle imaging. We successfully developed solutions to all subproblems involving image orientation clustering through deterministic (for noiseless data) and heuristic (for noisy data) techniques. Key solutions include the usage of image hashing for noiseless classification and a modified K-means algorithm for noisy data classification.
