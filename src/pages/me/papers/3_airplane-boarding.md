Another math modeling paper, this time for IMMC 2022 (+ awarded Rank 9). In this paper, we presented a computational, Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the boarding time of a specified boarding method with a randomized set of passenger parameters. Meanwhile, we also presented a closed-form formula to estimate the optimal disembarking time for any aircraft.
