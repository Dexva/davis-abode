# FlexiClaw

This was a very fun design project which I submitted to the ACAM 2021 Winnovator Techfest (what a punny name).

It is a scaleable, monolithic bi-claw compliant mechanism meant to serve as an alternative to common rigid claw mechanisms that tend to have multiple parts, and are therefore prone to wear and tear and difficult to fabricate in tiny sizes. Most of the design principles is inspired by work from the [BYU Compliant Mechanisms Research Group](https://www.compliantmechanisms.byu.edu/).

Our prototype was 3D printed using regular PLA filament on an Ender 3 printer.
