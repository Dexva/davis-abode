# FlexiClaw

This was one of my team's submission to the ACAM 2021 Winnovator Techfest. In fact, this was the one I principally designed!

FlexiClaw is a scaleable, monolithic bi-claw compliant mechanism meant to serve a similar purpose to common rigid claw mechanisms that tend to have multiple parts, and are therefore prone to wear and tear and difficult to fabricate in tiny sizes. Most of the design principles is inspired by work from the [BYU Compliant Mechanisms Research Group](https://www.compliantmechanisms.byu.edu/).

A prototype of this design was also 3D-printed using regular PLA filament on an Ender 3. 

Recently, FlexiClaw was also successfully registered as an _industrial design_ intellectual property in the Philippines:
