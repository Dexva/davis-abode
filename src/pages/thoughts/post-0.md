> Where do _thoughts_ come from?

A biologist might say it's inside our brains.
We chemists would argue it's caused by minute reactions that release energy.
Physicists, well, would just blame the [Maxwell equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations). 

Regardless of what it is, I hope you, dear reader, can enjoy all the thoughts that I'll be dumping on this site--from academic ideas, broke-college-student recipes, and even 日本語の練習.

... now don't mind the rest of this post, 'cause it's me testing I'll also be testing `.md` styling here.

```py
def func():
    #this is python code
```
