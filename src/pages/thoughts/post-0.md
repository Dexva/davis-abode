> Where do _thoughts_ come from?

A biologist might say it's inside our brains.
We chemists would argue it's caused by minute reactions that release energy.
Physicists, well, would just blame the [Maxwell equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations). 

Regardless of what it is, I hope you, dear reader, can enjoy all the thoughts that I'll be dumping on this site--from academic ideas, broke-college-student recipes, and even 日本語の練習.

... now don't mind the rest of this post, 'cause I'll also be testing `.md` and [thoughts page](/thoughts/) styling here.

## Experiments ahead! [2#]

### Math

Inline equation: $1+2=3, \hat{H}\psi = E\psi$.

Equation block:
$$
J(\theta_0, \theta_1)
= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2
$$

Align block: 

$$
\begin{align*}
    \theta_0
    &:= \theta_0 - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_0} \\
    &= \theta_0 - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m(h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})
\end{align*}
$$


### Code

```py
def func():
    #this is python code
```
