If there is one fun fact you should know about me, it should be that I _really_ really love _sinigang_. That is why, when I came to Japan for college, I made sure to make space for a ton of [_sinigang mix_](https://www.knorr.com/ph/p/sinigang-sa-sampalok-original.html/04800888600790).

Over the past year of living in Kyoto, I have tried out different different variations of this dish--from the classic _sinigang na baboy_ (pork sinigang) to even sinigang pasta (don't even ask. it tasted as it sounds). And so today, in order for me to not forget how I made it, I want to record my favorite version: _sinigang sa miso_ (specifically with salmon).



## Ingredients

As someone living in Japan, these are the ingredients that I find easily:

- ~400g Salmon _(Pro tip: for those residing in Kyoto, there's a fresh ~500 yen salmon trimmings at Hankyu Square)_
- 1 tomato, slice into 8ths
- 1 onion (red or white), slice into 8ths or 12ths
- 3-4 Shishito pepper
- Fish sauce (but soy sauce also OK)
- Veggies (eggplant/なす, okra/オクラ, leafy/ホウレンぞ, etc.)
- Sinigang mix (classic, or with miso)
- Miso paste
- Shrimp cubes (I use the _Knorr_ one)

This should be good for around 4 servings. 

## What to do

All heat levels indicated by **[n]** are for the induction stovetops in my dorm.  

1. On medium heat [3~4], sear your chopped onions and tomato in a bit of neutral oil.

2. Once the tomatoes have released some juice, add a bit of hot water and continue simmering. Add a tablespoon of miso paste, a shrimp cube, and a tablespoon of fish sauce (or soy sauce).

3. Once you feel like the color has become uniform, add your salmon and shishito peppers then fill the pan/pot with hot water. Cook for ~25 minutes.
